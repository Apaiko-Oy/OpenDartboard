/**
 * #899: the board is asked whether it is still looking at what it calibrated on.
 *
 * Called by Scorer after a sight loss has been survived and the cameras have been
 * reopened, on a fresh average of frames. What comes back is a verdict and the numbers it
 * was reached by; `calibrations` is not touched, and the board goes on scoring with the
 * geometry it earned at start or it stops scoring at all.
 *
 * WHICH CAMERAS ARE ASKED. Only the ones that were scoring: #1318 lets a camera that is
 * not looking at a dartboard abstain for the life of the run, and a slot that abstained
 * has no held geometry to compare a fresh picture against. A camera that has not come
 * back yet -- an empty frame in its slot -- abstains here too, because "this camera is
 * still missing" is a fact about the recovery and not about whether the board moved.
 *
 * WHAT IT TAKES TO SAY `Unchanged`. One camera that was scoring, is back, still sees a
 * dartboard, and agrees. That is #1318's `cameras_that_must_see = 1` read forward rather
 * than a second, stricter quorum invented here: a board that can score on one camera can
 * be vouched for by one camera. The refusal is the other quantifier on purpose -- ANY
 * camera that disagrees is a `Moved`, and it returns on the first one, because one
 * camera that has been shifted is enough to put a dart in the wrong wedge.
