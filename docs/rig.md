# The deployment rig, as measured

The hardware facts constants depend on, each with its source and date. A constant in
code that encodes a rig fact should cite this page; a fact here that stops being true
gets corrected in place with a note, the way the ground-truth files do.

## Cameras

**Three OmniVision OV9732 modules** — stated by the maintainer, 2026-09-24 (recorded
on turnaus#1513). Datasheet facts that follow from the model, not yet verified on
these units:

- 1/4-inch CMOS, native **1280x720**, 1.0 MP. The rig captures at native resolution,
  so there is no crop or scale between sensor and image: pixel (u,v) is photosite
  (u,v), and the square-pixel assumption is datasheet-backed (**3.0 um** pitch,
  f_px = f_mm / 0.003).
- **Rolling shutter.** Irrelevant to static wire/ring measurement; relevant to any
  future claim about a dart in flight.
- Streams **MJPG 1280x720 @ 30 fps**; three at once on one bus, which is only
  reachable compressed — measured by #1319/#1336 (55.3 MB/s would be needed raw for
  a single camera).

**The lens is not identified exactly, but the market and the footage bound it**
(web survey + arithmetic, 2026-09-24, turnaus#1513). OV9732 USB modules ship
overwhelmingly in two lens variants: **72 degrees** (3.6 mm, f/2.4, 2G2P) and
**100 degrees** ("no deformity", low-distortion wide). The 72-degree variant is
excluded by footage already: f = 3.6 mm / 3.0 um = 1200 px would draw the doubles
ring at ~680 px radius from ~300 mm standoff, and the fixtures measure the whole
board at 194–250 px. So the rig's lens is a wide variant — f roughly 400–600 px —
and `perspective_processing.cpp`'s hard-coded 120-degree diagonal (f ≈ 424 px) is
plausibly near rather than wildly wrong. The listed "no deformity" claim, if this
is that variant, also predicts a small k1. turnaus#1560 is the footage census that
measures f and k1 per camera and settles it; a lens-barrel marking, if ever read,
corroborates for free.

**On Windows/MSMF the FOURCC read-back is 0x00000016** (`MFVideoFormat_RGB32`'s
Data1) on all three cameras — OpenCV's own conversion target, not anything the
camera transmits. A format read there can never refuse a camera (#1336).

## Geometry

- Standoff **~300 mm** from the board, three cameras — `bull_processing.hpp`'s
  #1340 census.
- Live orientation anchors as of 2026-09-19: `OD_CAMERA_WEDGES="9,4,3"` in `--cams`
  order. The middle camera sits on the 13/4 boundary; if it disagrees with its
  neighbours by one wedge, flip to 13.
- **The rig changed after `mocks/rig-20260918` was recorded** (maintainer,
  2026-09-19): that fixture stays valid for mechanisms and board-relative
  thresholds, but per-camera facts — anchors, calibration — must be re-read from
  the live setup.
- Camera 1 on the current setup sits near the admission threshold: twenty-fold wire
  coherence measured at 0.578 against the 0.60 gate on `mocks/rig-20260922`
  replays, admitting on some runs and not others (turnaus#1551).

## Board

Winmau Blade 6. Scoring radii are `DartboardSpec`/`BoardProfile`
(`board_model.hpp`, versioned); the 450 mm the manufacturer lists is the overall
diameter, not the scoring diameter.

## Fixtures

- `mocks/rig-20260918/` — evidence, with `GROUND-TRUTH.md` (21 throws, 2 misses).
- `mocks/rig-20260922/` — the deployment recording; starts with a parked dart
  (#1514), clean frame ≈ index 270 (~9 s), visit 1 is `8 16 miss` (corrected
  2026-09-24), footage ends mid-visit 8. Its `GROUND-TRUTH.md` carries the details.
- `mocks/cam_*.mp4` — upstream footage, **never evidence** (#1478); see
  `mocks/DO-NOT-USE-cam_1-cam_2-cam_3.md`.
- A lit, clean, complete re-recording is wanted: turnaus#1558.
